# performance.measureMemory API

Last updated: 2020-02-21

## tl;dr
We propose a new `peformance.measureMemory` API that estimates memory usage of a web page including all its iframes and workers. The API is available only for [cross-origin isolated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/crossOriginIsolated) web pages that opt in using [the COOP+COEP headers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit) preventing cross-origin information leaks.

Example:
```JavaScript
const result = await performance.measureMemory();
console.log(result);
// Console output:
{
  bytes: 100*MB,
  breakdown: [
    {bytes: 40*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://foo.com']},
    {bytes: 30*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://bar.com/iframe']},
    {bytes: 20*MB, type: 'worker', attribution: ['https://foo.com/worker']},
    {bytes: 10*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://foo.com', 'https://bar.com/iframe']},
  ]
}
```

## Problem
As shown in [this collection of use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u21oa3-R1FhHgrPsh8-mpb8dIFVj60wcFiM5FFrfIQA/edit#heading=h.6si74uwp7sq8) there is a need for an API that measures memory footprint of web pages in production.
The use cases include a) analysis of correlation between memory usage and user metrics, b) detection of memory regressions, c) evaluation of feature launches in A/B tests, d) memory optimization.

Currently developers resort to the non-standard `performance.memory` API that [is used in 20%](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/884) of page loads in Chrome.
The API reports the size of the JS heap and thus has two major drawbacks:
1) it may greatly _overestimate_ the actual memory usage if other large web pages share the same heap.
2) it may greatly _underestimate_ the actual memory usage if the web page spawns workers and/or embeds cross-site iframes that are allocated in separate heaps.

In this proposal we aim to fix these drawbacks and set the following requirements for the new API.

### Requirements
- The API does not leak cross-origin information.
- The API measures memory usage of the web page including all its iframes and workers.
- The API accounts only the objects allocated by the web page. Other web pages do not affect the result.
- The API provides breakdown of the result by type and owner with implementation-specific granularity.
- The API has no overhead when it is not used.
- The API is defined based on the standard concepts from HTML and ECMAScript specifications and does not assume any particular process model.

### Non-Goals
- Precise memory measurement. Implementations are allowed to return an estimate because computing the precise result may be expensive.
- Complete memory measurement. Implementations are free to account as many memory types (JS, DOM, CSS) as possible, but they are not required to account all memory types. Memory types that cannot be isolated per page can be omitted.
- Comparing memory usage across browsers. The API results are browser implementation specific.
- Synchronous memory measurement before and after a specific action. The API has an asynchronous interface to allow folding the measurement into garbage collection and perform necessary interprocess communication. It may take seconds or minutes until the result is available.

## Related Work
### JavaScript agent memory API
The current proposal is generalization and extension of the previous [JavaScript agent memory API proposal](https://github.com/ulan/javascript-agent-memory/blob/master/explainer.md)  that was presented at [WebPerf WG F2F June 2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ANc7fbKpjs__Qw_0DxM74u49276vTwRwCPyBxUkfBw/edit#heading=h.nraz045xllk0) meeting.

The main difference is that the current proposal relies on COOP+COEP for security.
This allows us to increase the scope of the API beyond a single JavaScript agent to cover cross-origin iframes, workers as well as other kinds of memory.

### Process memory API
There was a proposal for [process memory API](https://github.com/WICG/performance-memory/blob/master/explainer.md) that estimates memory footprint of the site and accounts different types of memory: JS, DOM, CSS, Web Workers spawned by the page, etc.
The proposal [was initially blocked](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/85#issuecomment-426382208) by information leak of opaque cross-origin resources and is currently abandoned.

Our proposal combines this process memory API with the JS agent memory API.
The main difference between our proposal and the process memory API is that the scope of the process memory API is limited to the current [JS agent cluster](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-agent-cluster-formalism) (The proposal uses the old term -- "related similar-origin browsing contexts").
This means that the API measures only same-site memory and does not measure cross-site iframes.
In contrast to that, our API measures all JS agent clusters of the current [browsing context group](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context-group).
Besides that, our API provides breakdown of the result by type and owner.

### Memory pressure API
There is a proposal for [memory pressure API](https://github.com/WICG/memory-pressure/blob/master/explainer.md) that notifies the application about system memory pressure events.
This gives the application an opportunity to change its behavior at runtime to reduce its memory usage if possible e.g. by freeing up caches and unused resources.
Our proposal has different [use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u21oa3-R1FhHgrPsh8-mpb8dIFVj60wcFiM5FFrfIQA/edit#heading=h.6si74uwp7sq8) such as collecting telemetry data and detecting regressions.
Thus the two proposals are orthogonal.

## API Proposal
The API consists of a single asynchronous method `performance.measureMemory` that estimates memory usage of the web page and provides breakdown of the result by type and owner.
More formally, the API estimates memory usage of all [JS agent clusters](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-agent-cluster-formalism) of the current [browsing context group](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context-group) including shared resources such as ServiceWorkers, SharedWorkers, SharedArrayBuffers.

```JavaScript
const result = await performance.measureMemory();
console.log(result);
// Console output:
{
  bytes: 100*MB,
  breakdown: [
    {bytes: 40*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://foo.com']},
    {bytes: 30*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://bar.com/iframe']},
    {bytes: 20*MB, type: 'worker', attribution: ['https://foo.com/worker']},
    {bytes: 10*MB, type: 'window', attribution: ['https://foo.com', 'https://bar.com/iframe']},
  ]
}
```
The `bytes` field contains the total estimate of the web page's memory usage.

Each entry of the `breakdown` array describes some portion of the memory and attributes it to a set of windows and workers identified by URLs.
We expect implementations to differ in the granularity of attribution.
An implementation may return `attribution: []` indicating that the portion of the memory is attributed to the whole web page.
The example above has fine-grained attribution for first three entries and coarse-grained attribution for the last entry.
(I.e., the implementation cannot distinguish whether the last memory is attributed to `https://foo.com` or `https://bar.com/iframe`.)

In order to prevent URL leaks, cross-origin iframes are considered opaque for the purposes of attribution.
This means the memory of all iframes and workers nested in a cross-origin iframe is attributed to the cross-origin iframe.
Additionally, the reported URL of a cross-origin iframe is the original URL of the iframe at load time because that URL is known to the web page.
There are no restrictions for same-origin iframes because the web page can read their URLs at any time.

The `type` field provides more information about the memory. It contains one of the following values:

- `'gpu'`: the memory was allocated on the Graphics Processing Unit (i.e. canvas memory).
- `'shared'`: the memory is shared between workers and/or windows (e.g. memory of SharedArrayBuffers).
- `'window'`: the memory is allocated by a window.
- `'worker'`: the memory is allocated by a worker (including SharedWorker and ServiceWorker).

Adding a `UASpecific` suffix would emphasize that the API result is implementation dependent:
```JavaScript
  {bytesUASpecific: 40*MB, ...},

```
Our preference however is to communicate the message in documentation and keep the API concise and consistent with other Performance APIs.


## Security Considerations
### Cross-origin information leak
Only [cross-origin isolated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/crossOriginIsolated) web pages that opt in using [the COOP+COEP headers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit) can use the API.
This prevents cross-origin information leaks because all iframes and resources have to explicitly opt in using CORP/CORS.
Additionally it is guaranteed that a cross-origin isolated web page is not collocated with other web pages in the same address space.

All URLs reported in the `breakdown` part of the result are known to the web page, so there is no information leak.

An attempt to invoke the API when
`crossOriginIsolated === false` leads to promise rejection with a `SecurityError` DOM exception.
```JavaScript
try {
  const result = await performance.measureMemory();
} catch (error) {
  console.assert(!crossOriginIsolated);
  console.assert(error instanceof DOMException);
  console.assert(error.name === 'SecurityError');
  console.assert(error.message === 'crossOriginIsolated is required');
}
```


### Fingerprinting
Implementations need to be careful to avoid leaking information about the underlying browser instance.
Ideally the API returns `0` (or some other constant) for empty web pages such that the result depends only on the objects allocated by the web page.

Some information leak is unavoidable though. The web page can deduce:
- the bitness of the system (32-bit vs 64-bit).
- the version of the browser to some extent.

Note that such information can be obtained from the existing APIs (`navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.deviceMemory`).

## Performance Considerations
The API with coarse-grained breakdown can be implemented efficiently provided that the browser does not collocate a cross-origin web page with other web pages in the same process.
In such a case the API can return the sizes of the heaps (JS, DOM, CSS, worker, etc) with empty attributions.

Fine-grained attribution requires more expensive computation because objects from different frames may be allocated on the same heap.
One possible implementation is to segregate objects by frame during allocation.
Alternative implementation is to infer the object's frame while traversing the object graph during garbage collection.
This was implemented in Chrome/V8 and introduces 10%-20% overhead to garbage collection (only if there is a pending memory measurement request).
See [Implementation Notes](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) for more details.

## API Usage
The API is well-suited for A/B testing, regressions detection, and general analysis of aggregate memory usage data from production.
Results of individual API calls are less useful because they are sensitive to timing w.r.t web page and user actions.
We recommend calling the API periodically every `N` minutes.
Even better would be to use statistical sampling such as Poisson sampling to avoid the bias of a fixed sampling interval.

Note that due to [COOP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u21oa3-R1FhHgrPsh8-mpb8dIFVj60wcFiM5FFrfIQA/edit#heading=h.6si74uwp7sq8) restriction only the main frame of the web page can call the API.
(The `crossOriginIsolated` flag is always `false` for iframes.)
